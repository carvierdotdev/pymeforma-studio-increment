# Colors

Sure! Here are some alternative names for those colors that align with a blue-oriented theme:

• #F5F3EE: You could use lightBlueGrey or paleBlue.

• #E0E3DD: You could use softBlueGrey or mistyBlue.

• #0077CC: You could use deepBlue or oceanBlue.

These names should help keep your color naming consistent with the new blue theme of your project. If you need any more suggestions or further assistance, feel free to ask!
